# AI Emotion Detection CNN

## Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting emotions from facial expressions. The model is trained on a dataset of facial images and aims to classify emotions accurately, providing insights into human emotional responses.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YahyaHajji/AI_Emotion_Detection_CNN.git
   cd AI_Emotion_Detection_CNN
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the CNN model and evaluate its performance, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can modify hyperparameters and model architecture in the `main.py` file as needed.

## Dataset

This project uses a dataset of facial images labeled with various emotions. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the correct directory as specified in the code.
